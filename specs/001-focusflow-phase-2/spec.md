# Feature Specification: FocusFlow - Task Management and Focus Features

**Feature Branch**: `001-focusflow-phase-2`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# FocusFlow ‚Äî Phase 2: Specify ## 2.1 Functional Requirements (FR) - **FR-1 Tasks & Types** - Create/edit/delete tasks with: title, description, type (task | exam | meeting), status (Backlog | Todo | Doing | Done), priority, tags, dueAt, estimateHrs, spentHrs, attachments (links), reminders. - **Acceptance:** Can create a ‚ÄúMath Revision‚Äù task with due date & estimate; it immediately shows **ETA** and **timeLeft**. - **FR-2 Views** - **Kanban** (drag-drop changes status and order with optimistic UI). - **List** (search, filter by status/tag/date). - **Calendar** (month/week/day; clicking an event opens the editor). - **Acceptance:** Reordering persists on refresh; calendar shows all due items on correct dates. - **FR-3 Focus Room** - Pomodoro 25/5 and custom timers; scenic backgrounds (image/video); session log. - **Acceptance:** When a timer ends, a session record is created; user receives an in-app alert or push (if enabled). - **FR-4 Reminders** - Due-soon & overdue via **Web Push** (VAPID) and **Email** (Resend/Sendgrid). - **Acceptance:** A task due in 30m dispatches a reminder within ¬±2m. - **FR-5 Templates & Onboarding** - Templates: **Student Planner** and **Business Sprint** with pre-seeded lists/tags. - **Acceptance:** New user ‚Üí selects template ‚Üí first task created in <45s. - **FR-6 PWA** - Installable; offline **read** (Today/Upcoming) and **quick-add** with background sync. - **Acceptance:** In airplane mode, quick-added task syncs once online. - **FR-7 Data Export & Account Deletion** - Export all user data as JSON; deletion cascades all content. - **Acceptance:** Downloaded JSON validates against schema; no orphaned DB rows after deletion. ## 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) - **Security:** NextAuth sessions; secure headers (CSP/HSTS/XFO); CSRF on mutating actions; secrets only in env (Vercel). - **Reliability:** Target 99.5% uptime; daily DB backup; error boundaries and friendly fallback screens. - **Performance:** Lighthouse Perf/PWA ‚â• 90; TTFB < 500ms avg; TTI < 3s on mid-range Android; smooth DnD at 200+ cards. - **Compliance/Privacy:** Clear privacy policy; user-initiated deletion within 24h; minimal PII. ## 2.3 Architecture Snapshot - **App:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TS) + React 18 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + dnd-kit + FullCalendar. - **Backend:** Next.js server actions & API routes; Prisma ORM. - **DB:** Dev SQLite, Prod Postgres (Neon or Vercel PG). - **Notifications:** Web Push (VAPID) + Resend/Sendgrid email. - **PWA:** next-pwa/Workbox for caching & background sync. - **Jobs:** Vercel Scheduled Functions scan for due tasks. - **Secrets:** Vercel encrypted env vars; rotate quarterly. ## 2.4 Data Model (core) - **User**(id, email, name, tz, settings) - **Task**(id, userId, title, desc, type, status, priority, tags[], dueAt, estimateHrs, spentHrs, createdAt, updatedAt) - **Derived:** `eta = now + (estimateHrs - spentHrs)`; `timeLeft = dueAt - now` - **Session**(id, userId, taskId?, startAt, endAt, type: Pomodoro|Custom, plannedMins, actualMins, notes) - **Reminder**(id, userId, taskId, channel: push|email, whenAt, sentAt?) ## 2.5 Risks & Mitigations (delta) - Asset bloat from scenes ‚Üí CDN, lazy-load, image fallback. - Browser blocks push ‚Üí email + in-app banners. - Estimate accuracy ‚Üí post-session "adjust estimate" nudge. - Scope creep (teams) ‚Üí feature flags, post-MVP."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student or professional with multiple deadlines, exams, and meetings to manage, I want to create and track tasks with detailed information (title, description, type, status, priority, tags, due date, time estimates), view them in different layouts (Kanban, List, Calendar), use a focus timer to stay productive, and receive timely reminders, all with a clean, intuitive interface that works offline as a Progressive Web App.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I create a "Math Revision" task with a due date and time estimate, **Then** I immediately see the calculated ETA and timeLeft displayed on the task.
2. **Given** I am viewing the Kanban board, **When** I drag and drop a task card to change its status or position, **Then** the UI updates immediately (optimistic update) and the change persists after page refresh.
3. **Given** I am on the calendar view, **When** I click on a task/event, **Then** an editor opens allowing me to modify the task details.
4. **Given** I am using the Focus Room with a Pomodoro timer, **When** the timer completes, **Then** a session record is automatically created and I receive an alert notification (in-app or push if enabled).
5. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I select a template (Student Planner or Business Sprint) during onboarding, **Then** I can create my first task within 45 seconds of selecting the template.
6. **Given** I am in offline mode on a PWA-enabled device, **When** I use the quick-add feature to create a task, **Then** the task is saved locally and automatically syncs when connectivity is restored.
7. **Given** I have tasks with upcoming due dates, **When** a task is due in 30 minutes, **Then** I receive a reminder notification within ¬±2 minutes of the due time.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has hundreds of tasks and the drag-and-drop performance degrades?
- How does the system handle time zone differences when setting due dates and sending reminders?
- What occurs when a user deletes their account - are all related data properly removed?
- How does the system handle large background images in the Focus Room without impacting performance?
- What happens when web push notifications are blocked by the browser?
