# Research: FocusFlow - Task Management and Focus Features

## Completed Research Tasks

### Decision: Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- **Rationale**: Next.js 15 with App Router is the modern standard for React applications, providing excellent server-side rendering, routing, and TypeScript support. The App Router pattern aligns with constitutional principles of friction-free design through built-in data fetching and server components.
- **Alternatives considered**: Create React App, Vite with React, Remix - Next.js was chosen for its ecosystem integration, PWA capabilities, and strong TypeScript support.

### Decision: Database Strategy (SQLite for Dev, Postgres for Prod)
- **Rationale**: SQLite provides an easy development setup with no external dependencies, while Postgres offers production-grade performance, scalability, and advanced features. Prisma ORM provides a seamless transition between the two.
- **Alternatives considered**: MySQL, MongoDB, PlanetScale - Postgres was selected for its strong ACID compliance and JSON capabilities for flexible data storage.

### Decision: UI Framework (shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS)
- **Rationale**: shadcn/ui provides accessible, customizable components that follow best practices, while Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling for rapid development. This combination supports the constitutional principle of user experience priority.
- **Alternatives considered**: Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design - shadcn/ui was chosen for its clean design, accessibility features, and ease of customization.

### Decision: Drag-and-Drop Implementation (dnd-kit)
- **Rationale**: dnd-kit is the modern, accessible drag-and-drop library that works well with React and offers better performance and accessibility than older alternatives. It's essential for implementing the Kanban board requirement.
- **Alternatives considered**: react-dnd, HTML5 drag-and-drop API - dnd-kit was chosen for its active maintenance, accessibility features, and better performance.

### Decision: Calendar Implementation (FullCalendar)
- **Rationale**: FullCalendar provides a feature-rich, customizable calendar component that meets the requirement for month/week/day views with event integration. It has good React support and accessibility features.
- **Alternatives considered**: react-big-calendar, react-calendar, date-fns with custom implementation - FullCalendar was chosen for its comprehensive feature set and ease of integration.

### Decision: PWA Implementation (next-pwa)
- **Rationale**: next-pwa is a well-maintained, Next.js-specific PWA solution that integrates seamlessly with the Next.js build process and provides offline capabilities, install prompts, and background sync as required by constitutional principles.
- **Alternatives considered**: manual service worker, Create React App PWA features - next-pwa was chosen for its Next.js integration and active maintenance.

### Decision: Authentication (NextAuth.js)
- **Rationale**: NextAuth.js provides secure, easy-to-implement authentication that integrates well with Next.js applications. It supports multiple providers and handles sessions securely, meeting security requirements.
- **Alternatives considered**: Auth0, Clerk, Firebase Auth - NextAuth was chosen for its self-hosting capability and flexibility.

### Decision: Testing Strategy (Vitest + Cypress)
- **Rationale**: Vitest provides fast unit and integration testing with a Jest-like API but faster performance. Cypress provides reliable end-to-end testing with good debugging capabilities. This combination supports the constitutional principle of quality standards.
- **Alternatives considered**: Jest only, Playwright, Testing Library - The Vitest + Cypress combination was chosen for speed and reliability respectively.

## Outstanding Questions
- None at this time. All technical unknowns have been addressed based on the requirements.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router provides server-side rendering, client-side navigation, and API routes in a single framework
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite for development and Postgres for production offers type safety and easy database transitions
- **State Management**: React state with server actions for server-side mutations, reducing client-side complexity
- **Caching**: Next.js server components for server-side caching and React Query for client-side data caching
