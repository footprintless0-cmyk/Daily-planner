# Specification Analysis Report

This report analyzes the consistency and quality across `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` for the FocusFlow project.

## Findings Summary

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Status |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| D1 | Constitution alignment | RESOLVED | spec.md,plan.md,tasks.md | Missing explicit security implementation tasks for constitutional requirement | ✅ ADDED: T036-T038 for NextAuth, security headers, and CSRF |
| D2 | Constitution alignment | RESOLVED | tasks.md | No explicit accessibility (WCAG AA) implementation tasks mentioned | ✅ ADDED: T054-T056 for accessibility compliance |
| D3 | Constitution alignment | RESOLVED | tasks.md | No specific drag-and-drop cross-layer integration testing tasks | ✅ ADDED: T011 for cross-layer integration testing |
| E1 | Coverage gap | RESOLVED | spec.md:Non-Functional Requirements; tasks.md | Performance requirements (Lighthouse ≥90, <100ms DnD) not reflected in tasks | ✅ ADDED: Phase 3.6 for performance optimization |
| E2 | Coverage gap | RESOLVED | spec.md:Edge Cases; tasks.md | Several edge cases from spec not addressed in tasks (timezone handling, browser push blockers) | ✅ ADDED: T067 for edge case handling |
| F1 | Inconsistency | RESOLVED | plan.md:Structure Decision; tasks.md | Plan mentions backend/structure but Next.js implementation combines frontend/backend | ✅ CLARIFIED: Updated structure to note API routes serve as backend |
| F2 | Inconsistency | RESOLVED | spec.md:title vs tasks.md | Spec mentions "Math Revision" task example but tasks don't include test for this specific scenario | ✅ ADDED: T008 acceptance scenario for Math Revision |
| C1 | Underspecification | RESOLVED | spec.md:FR-009; tasks.md | Scenic backgrounds implementation underspecified - no details about image/video handling | ✅ ENHANCED: Added FR-009 with caching/performance details |
| B1 | Ambiguity | RESOLVED | plan.md:Performance Goals; tasks.md:T060 | Vague performance terms like "smooth DnD at 200+ cards" without measurable criteria | ✅ ADDED: FR-021, FR-022 with specific metrics |
| A1 | Duplication | RESOLVED | spec.md:FR-011,FR-012; tasks.md | Similar reminder requirements (web push and email) consolidated | ✅ HANDLED: Tasks T035, T047 handle both channels in unified functionality |

## Constitution Alignment Issues

All constitutional requirements have been addressed:
1. ✅ **Security Requirements**: Added tasks for NextAuth sessions, secure headers (CSP/HSTS/XFO), and CSRF protection
2. ✅ **Accessibility Requirements**: Added tasks for WCAG AA compliance
3. ✅ **Integration Testing**: Added cross-layer integration tests for drag-and-drop functionality
4. ✅ **Performance Standards**: Added specific performance optimization tasks (Lighthouse ≥90, <100ms DnD)
5. ✅ **Data Privacy**: All data privacy requirements already covered

## Unmapped Tasks

All tasks now have proper alignment with requirements or constitutional principles.

## Metrics

* Total Requirements: 22 (expanded from 17 with constitutional requirements)
* Total Tasks: 68 (expanded from 61 with additional requirements)
* Coverage %: 100% (all requirements have >=1 task)
* Ambiguity Count: 0
* Duplication Count: 0
* Critical Issues Count: 0

## Next Actions

✅ All issues have been rectified and artifacts are now consistent across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md.

The overall architecture and task breakdown is now solid, with complete coverage of constitutional requirements, clear performance metrics, and detailed specifications for all features. All security, accessibility, and performance requirements from the constitution are now explicitly addressed in the tasks.

All cross-artifact inconsistencies have been resolved and the implementation can now proceed.
